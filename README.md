## 📸 Features — What Can ToolMitra Do?

| Tool Name             | What It Does |
|----------------------|--------------|
| 🔍 **Background Remover** | Removes the background of an image and lets you replace it with transparent, solid color, gradient, or even another image. Perfect for product photos or clean cutouts. |
| ✨ **Image Enhancer** | Boosts image clarity by improving brightness, sharpness, and contrast — all with a single click. Ideal for low-light or faded images. |
| 📉 **Image Compressor** | Compresses image size without losing much quality. You can reduce by percentage or specify the exact size (e.g., 200 KB or 1 MB). |
| ✂️ **Image Cropper** | Easily crop any image by uploading and selecting the desired area. A live crop-preview makes precision super easy. |
| 📄 **Image to PDF** | Upload multiple images and convert them into a single downloadable PDF document. Great for sharing scanned docs or photos. |
| 🔖 **Stamp Tool** | Add your signature or custom stamp to any image. Upload a transparent PNG, drag it where you want it, and download the final stamped image. |
